> “Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, because ***it teaches you how to think***.” - Steve Jobs

Competitive Programming is a synergy between creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and so much more. In competitive programming contests, you are given questions ranging in difficulty and you must design and implement an efficient algorithm to satisfy the specified problem statement under specific constraints (ie. time & memory). The most common languages used in competitive programming are C++, Java and Python respectively. Each language have their disadvantages and advantages however most people prefer C++ for its speed, flexibility and thorough library (STL).

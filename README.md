## Introduction

### What's Competitive Programming?
> “Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, because ***it teaches you how to think***.” - Steve Jobs

Competitive Programming is a synergy between creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and so much more. In competitive programming contests, you are given questions ranging in difficulty and you must design and implement an efficient algorithm to satisfy the specified problem statement under specific constraints (ie. time & memory). The most common languages used in competitive programming are C++, Java and Python respectively. Each language have their disadvantages and advantages however most people prefer C++ for its speed, flexibility and thorough library (STL). 

### My Journey
Date | Description
------------ | -------------
July 2019 | Started Learning Python
Aug/Sep 2019 | Made my first project!
January 2020 | Heard about CCC/started reviewing Python
January 2020 | Made my DMOJ account (https://dmoj.ca/user/utkm)
February 2020 | Wrote the Junior Contest in Python
March 2020 | Got interested in Competitive Programming & started doing problems
April 2020 | Started learning C++ & reading material online

I switched to C++ from Python since I felt that C++ had a lot more to offer than Python. Although Python was very intuitive and user-friendly, most of the material for Competitive Programming online was written for C++. I figured this was for a reason and started to research its advantages. I realized that C++ can be 400x faster than Python (very important considering time limits) and that it offered a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to define your own macros etc.
